# BionicReader
Revises texts so that the most concise parts of words are highlighted.

Hack that could transform the way students with ADHD and dyslexia read and study.

▸ Bionic reading facilitates the reading process by guiding the eyes through text with artificial fixation points. To make it short: some parts of the words are displayed in bold text. 

▸ As a result, you are focusing on the highlighted text (usually initial letters of the words) and your brain completes the rest. It saves time, because your brain “reads” faster than your eyes.
